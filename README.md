## About

Firmware for a air quality monitoring device using ESP32 as microcontroller,
SCD30 as CO2, temperature and humidity sensor, BME280 as pressure and altitude
sensor, an 0.96" OLED display based on the SSD1306 and a NeoPixel (WS2812B)
semaphore like interface.

The firmware is written in Arduino (C++) using Adafruit Industries libraries
and Espressif Arduino Core.
